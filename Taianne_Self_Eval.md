- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel good about using comparison operators. I do feel I need more practice, and the more I do, the more confident. 

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I feel confident using logical operators symbols to help me define True or False boolean values. I do have to confess that only by practing, that I could understand and feel confident about it. 

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I love the magic of the if/else statements. It dictates the program's flow, in the specified conditions. Its a fundamental control structure tool. In the beginning I was very confused. But once you undertand it, it gets super easy to use it. 

-How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

It took me few hours to hrough everything with patience and grace. Some questions in which I privately asked for help, researched and learned. I love learning and the fact that it gets easier over time, makes me feel very excited and confident for Mod 1.

-What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I will never stop learning as a programmer. So much to learn, to repeat, repeat, memorize, search into. It would be impossible to say that I got everything easy at first, and finished all the assignemtns in the same very moment as I began to work with them. I still need to practice a bit of everything, but the fundamental part, concept, codes, Terminal performance, Github, Replit, Vs Code and etc... , that I can absolutely perform on. I already prioritized my next weeks, til Mod 1, to focus on going over Mod 0 again, study, watch Youtube videos, excercise, so I can keep refresing my mind. Morning, afternoon and evening, I'll be having couple hours a day to make sure I feel free and comfortable with any CFU, and tasks ahead. 


- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I dont have any other question to make. I have asked eveything I needed to know as I finish the homework and submmission of it. But when I did have questions, I asked my class mates, and instructors. I did some googling too. Which always helps, especially if I'm working late and with my timezone, no one is available to help.
