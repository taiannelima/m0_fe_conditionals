// In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated to achieve the desired result.
// One example is already completed. Your task is to complete any remaining prompt.
// Make sure to run the file in your command line using `node <filename>.js`


// -------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
// -------------------

var numberTeachers = 4
var numberStudents = 20
var stringTeachers = "4"
var numberDogs = 0

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?
// this should log: false
console.log("is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers === stringTeachers)

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?", numberTeachers != numberStudents)
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false
console.log("is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21)

// #-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
// #-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a comment,in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.

var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// Here we have the variables declared first, and assigned to its value.
// the comparison wil check if the value of ''Friends'' is greater than the value of ''siblings''.
//since it is, "console.loog" output will return ''true'' because there are more "friends" than "siblings". 
console.log (6 > 2);
// "console.loog" output will return ''true'' because there are more "friends" than "siblings"


var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// in this line we have the number of "attendees" and "meals" declared and assigned to its value.
// comparison will check if the number of "attendees" isn't the same as "meals"
// "console.log" will print "true" since the number of "attendees" isn't the same as "meals"


// #-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
// #-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);
// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);
// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
// HINT: Use the age variable and assume that a puppy is less than 2 years old
console.log(lovesToPlay && age <= 2);
