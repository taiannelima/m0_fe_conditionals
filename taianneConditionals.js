var numberTeachers = 4

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?
// this should log: false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false
